    <p>
      Welcome to PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L, your AI-assisted mental health resource. The mission is to provide you
      with the tools and support needed to improve your mental well-being. Whether you're seeking information,
      resources, or someone to talk to, I'm here for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L was created to be a safe and supportive space for individuals to explore mental
      health resources. The AI assistant, Grace, is here to chat with you, provide guidance, and connect you with
      valuable resources. Grace remembers your preferences and previous conversations to offer a personalized
      experience, and you can clear her memory anytime for a fresh start.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I believe that taking the first step towards better mental health should be as easy as possible. That's why I've
      gathered a wide range of resources, from crisis support to educational materials, all in one place. I hope to be
      the bridge between you and a brighter future.
    </p>

    <h2>The Creator</h2>
    <p>
      PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L is a personal project created by me, a former 911 paramedic. After experiencing
      firsthand the challenges and stresses of the emergency response system, I made the difficult decision to leave
      that career. The system, with its relentless demands and emotional toll, ultimately broke me. However, my passion
      for helping others remains strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I transition into the field of web development, I am channeling my skills and experiences into building this
      site. PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L represents my commitment to providing a supportive and resource-rich
      environment for those in need. Through this platform, I aim to offer valuable mental health resources and support,
      while also growing and learning as a developer.
