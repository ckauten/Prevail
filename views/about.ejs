      <h1>About PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L, your AI-assisted mental health resource. The mission is to provide you
        with the tools and support needed to improve your mental well-being. Whether you're seeking information,
        resources, or someone to talk to, I'm here for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L was created to be a safe and supportive space for individuals to explore mental
        health resources. The AI assistant, Grace, is here to chat with you, provide guidance, and connect you with
        valuable resources. Grace remembers your preferences and previous conversations to offer a personalized
        experience, and you can clear her memory anytime for a fresh start.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I believe that taking the first step towards better mental health should be as easy as possible. That's why I've
        gathered a wide range of resources, from crisis support to educational materials, all in one place. I hope to be
        the bridge between you and a brighter future.
      </p>

      <h2>The Creator</h2>
      <p>
        PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L is a personal project created by me, a former 911 paramedic. After experiencing
        firsthand the challenges and stresses of the emergency response system, I made the difficult decision to leave
        that career. The system, with its relentless demands and emotional toll, ultimately broke me. However, my
        passion for helping others remains strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I transition into the field of web development, I am channeling my skills and experiences into building this
        site. PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L represents my commitment to providing a supportive and resource-rich
        environment for those in need. Through this platform, I aim to offer valuable mental health resources and
        support, while also growing and learning as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is not just a project; it's a mission to make a positive impact on the lives of others, inspired by my
        past experiences and fueled by my new journey in web development. I am dedicated to continuously improving and
        expanding PREV<span id="ai">AI</span>L to better serve the community.
